The figure shows the correlation matrix of a numerical data. The matrix displays the correlation between different mean variables (such as mean_ghgs, mean_land, mean_watscar, mean_eut, mean_ghgs_ch4, mean_ghgs_2o, mean_bio, mean_watuse, and mean-acid).


I have designed interactive charts, and you can view their data changes by clicking on different labels, and I will demonstrate this in the video.

This chart is a box plot that displays the distribution of scaled values for different environmental variables (mean_ghgs, mean_land, mean_watcar, mean_eut, mean_ghgs_ch4, mean_ghgs_2o, mean_bio, mean_watuse, mean-acid) based on individual gender (female, male), age range (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79), and meat consumption level (<50, 50-99).
Grouping is encoded by color, with fish consumption groups represented by different shades of red and meat consumption groups represented by different shades of orange. The box plot shows the median (line in the middle of each box), interquartile range (box itself), and outliers (points above and below the box).
From the graph, we can see that the scaling values of environmental variables vary among different groups. Some groups have larger median and interquartile ranges, while others have smaller values. The chart also shows several outliers in each group, indicating that some individuals have significantly higher or lower environmental impact values than others in the same group.

The vegan has the least impact on the environment, as evidenced by their lower average environmental impact indicators.
-Comparison of environmental impacts of meat, vegetarianism, and fish: Among all age groups and genders, the group that chooses a meat diet generally has a higher impact on environmental indicators such as greenhouse gas emissions and land use than the group that chooses a vegetarian diet. This emphasizes that reducing meat consumption may make a significant contribution to reducing the environmental footprint of individuals or society.
-The impact of age groups: Younger populations (such as those aged 20-29), whether choosing a fish, vegetarian, or meat diet, have slightly lower environmental impact on certain indicators compared to other age groups.
-Gender differences: In meat diets, men's environmental impact is slightly higher than women's in certain indicators, especially greenhouse gas emissions and land use.
